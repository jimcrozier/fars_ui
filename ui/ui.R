                               each variable under 'Variable Analysis'.  Lastly, you can configure and evaluate your 
                               model under the 'Modeling' tab.  The authors have included their results in the

                           surprising findings.

                           Using only data from 2014, there appears to be a statistically significant negative
                           relationship between speeding, alcohol consumption, and fatalities.  Some manufacturers are seemingly safer
                           than others - Dodge and Ford being safer, while Honda being less so.  Less obvious is the relationship
                           between environmental conditions and fatality.  One would think that rain or poor light could be significant 
                           factors, but in this data that is not the case.  Perhaps most surprising is the difference between rural
                           and urban travel.

                           Accidents that occur on rural roads are much more likely to result in a fatality than those that occur in
                           cities.  This statistical relationship is observable in the heat map for US counties, but it is not 
                           immediately clear what the underlying cause may be.  Are average speeds higher on rural roads?  Are there
                           more head on collisions?  These are some of the questions that beg further investigation.
